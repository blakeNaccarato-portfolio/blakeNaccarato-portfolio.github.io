summary: |-
  An automated droplet detection method in order to measure the droplet size distribution of dropwise condensation on a flat plate and a horizontal tube.

abstract: |-
  A droplet detection method has been developed to measure the distribution of droplet sizes on a flat plate under dropwise condensation. Dropwise condensation heat transfer may be modeled by combining an expression for the single droplet heat transfer rate with the droplet size distribution. The ability to measure this distribution is integral to the validation of such models. An example study is undertaken in which heat flux is obtained for a given surface treatment by implementing such a model and measuring the droplet size distribution. These results are compared with the heat flux measured by internal coolant temperature monitoring for external condensation on a tube featuring the same surface treatment. ...
